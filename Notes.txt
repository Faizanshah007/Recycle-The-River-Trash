TARGET AGE - (18 - 30)

Fully-completed, polished projects are not the intended outcomes of game jams.


If the youth of today are trained in a fun realistic simulated environment about how to go about cleaning thier river bodies. A lot of improvement.

Need to be blending in with the mainstream games. The whole purspose is defied if this doesnt happen.

How will I proceed
Maximizing the minimum art of war video

Hyperrealism, absent in lot of games such as SeAdventure

However, a
balance between fidelity and play must be considered in order to avoid the game achieving the “chocolatecovered
broccoli” designation (Bruckman, 1999; Habgood, 2007).

continuously exploring game jam games to add elements that reveamp the gameplay and serious environmental knowledge aspect of the game.

Biodegradable wastes, e.g., human
and animal waste, food scraps, manufactured products based
on natural materials, etc. should be shot using the green gun.
On the other hand, non-biodegradable wastes such as plastic
products, metals, constructions wastes, etc. should be shot
using yellow gun. Lastly, recyclable wastes such as plastic,
textiles, tires, cardboards, electronics, etc. should be shot
using the blue gun.
